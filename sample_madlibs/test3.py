    madlib = f"A {adj1} glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of \
dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest {noun1}. The light hit both of their {body_part} \
at the same time, so that Jon Irenicus was suddenly a flaming {noun2}. Charname heard the high voice \
shriek as he too {verb_past} his best hope to the heavens, pointing Bodhi’s {noun3}:\n\
\"{spell1}!\"\n\
\"{spell2}!\"\n\
The bang was like a cannon blast, and the {adj2} flames that erupted between them, \
at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the \
{noun_plural} collided. Charname saw Irenicus’ {adj3} jet meet his own spell, saw the Bhaalspawn's soul \
fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling \
, spinning through the air toward the master it would not {verb}, who had \
come to take full possession of it at last. And Charname, with the unerring skill of a Seeker, \
caught the {noun4} in his free hand as Irenicus fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils \
of the {adj4} {body_part2} rolling upward. Irenicus hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body \
feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Irenicus \
was dead, {verb_past2} by his own rebounding {noun5}, and Charname stood with two souls in his hands, \
staring down at his enemy’s {noun6}."
